/*
 * "tsync" stands for "threads synchronisation", it provides a possible
 * implementation of the Readers-Writers model in a multi-thread environment
 * with the following features:
 *	. multi readers can co-exist;
 *	. a running writer excludes any other writer or reader;
 *	. if there is any existing writer, in particular, any waiting writer
 *	  due to running readers, no more readers are allowed;
 *	. synchronised shutdown.
 *
 * However, persistent in-coming writers will starve readers. Therefore
 * this implementation suits for cases when the number of readers outweighs
 * that of writers and writting operations are not time-consuming.
