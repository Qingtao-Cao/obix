	oBIX history service

	The History.Get operation will return the URI of the history facility for
	one specific device. Create it if it does not exist yet as long as the
	request comes from an oBIX Adapter(instead of oBIX client)

	So far only plain text format is supported in the raw history data file,
	however, system administrators are free to deploy a filesystem that supports
	compression.

	All history facilities for different devices are under histories/ sub href.
	Considering that it may contain hundreds of thousands lines of information
	the history service is declared as HIDDEN so as not to overwhelm the oBIX
	lobby object. Also this will help avoid displaying history service along
	with its reference node in the oBIX lobby already.
