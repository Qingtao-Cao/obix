<!--
	An example oBIX contract signed up at the oBIX server.

	The root node of the contract deliberately has the writable="true" setup
	so as to test that the signUp handler will always have it removed.

	Moreover, the "reset" sub node has an absolute href, however, the signUp
	handler will always trim absolute href down to relative href, except
	for any ref node of course.
